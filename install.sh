# If you remove the .example extension from the file, once your workspace is created and the contents of this
# repo are copied into it, this script will execute.  This will happen in place of the default behavior of the workspace system,
# which is to symlink the dotfiles copied from this repo to the home directory in the workspace.
#
# Why would one use this file in stead of relying upon the default behavior?
#
# Using this file gives you a bit more control over what happens.
# If you want to do something complex in your workspace setup, you can do that here.
# Also, you can use this file to automatically install a certain tool in your workspace, such as vim.
#
# Just in case you still want the default behavior of symlinking the dotfiles to the root,
# we've included a block of code below for your convenience that does just that.
